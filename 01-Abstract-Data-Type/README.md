# Abstract Data Type

An **abstract data type**(ADT) is an abstraction of a data structure which provides only the *interface* to which a data structure must adhere to.

The interface does not give any specific details about how something should be implemented or in what programming language.

For instance, suppose the ADT is a mode of transportation: walking, biking, etc.

## Examples

| Abstraction (ADT) 	| Implementation(DS)                                               	|
|-------------------	|-------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| List              	| Dynamic Array<br>Linked List                                      	|
| Queue             	| Linked List based Queue<br>Array based Queue<br>Stack based Queue 	|
| Map               	| Tree Map<br>Hash Map / Hash Table                                 	|
| Vehicle           	| Golf Cart<br>Bicycle<br>Smart Car                                 	|

The abstract data type only defines **how** a data structure should behave and **what** methods they should have, but not the details regarding method implementations.
